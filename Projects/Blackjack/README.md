# Blackjack Game Development in Python

## Game Rules:

1. The game will be played with a single deck of 52 cards.
2. The player and the dealer are dealt two cards each. However, only one of the dealer's cards is initially revealed.
3. The value of the cards is determined as follows: cards 2 to 10 are worth their numeric value; the cards J, Q, and K are each worth 10 points; and the Ace (A) can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on the hand.
4. The player can request additional cards ("hit") to try to reach a maximum value of 21 points, or they can decide to "stand" with their current score.
5. If the sum of the player's cards exceeds 21 points, they automatically lose.
6. The dealer must continue drawing additional cards until their score is equal to or greater than 17 points.
7. If the sum of the dealer's cards exceeds 21 points, they automatically lose.
8. If neither player exceeds 21 points, the winner is the one with the highest score. In the event of a tie, the game ends in a draw.

## Program Requirements:

1. The program should be implemented in Python.
2. The game should be interactive, allowing the player to make choices through commands in the terminal.
3. The program should shuffle the cards before the start of each round.
4. The player's and dealer's scores should be updated after each move.
5. The program should check if the player or dealer has exceeded 21 points after each move.
6. The program should determine the winner and display a result message at the end of each round.
7. The program should allow the player to decide whether to play again or exit the game.

## Expected Solution:

The developed program is expected to accurately simulate the rules of the blackjack game, allowing the player to make choices and displaying the results of each round appropriately. The code should also be readable, well-structured, and appropriately commented when necessary.
